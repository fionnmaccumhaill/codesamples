# codesamples

A git repository for me to stick code samples for the various
languages I use. Most of the recent coding I've been doing is in
ruby so that will probably get the most commits for the next couple
of months.

The code is not meant to be complete applications or classes. It is
just a place for me to put code that I would normally find by 
looking through the code I have already written or using google.
